The OmniBridge multi-token bridge extension is now being used to bridge many tokens from Ethereum to xDai. When a token is bridged, the name is appended with _**on xDai**_.  On a token page, you can also find the link to the original token on Ethereum. For more, see the [corresponding token contract addresses page](../correspondence-of-bridgeable-tokens.md).
