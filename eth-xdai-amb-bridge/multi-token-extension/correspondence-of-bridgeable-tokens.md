# Corresponding token contract addresses \(ETH - XDAI\)

There are several approaches to discover the token contract on the Ethereum Mainnet that corresponds to the token contract on the xDai chain.

## Approach \#1: BlockScout

BlockScout allows you to see if a token was bridged using the multi-token extension.

The link available on the token name leads to the token view in the BlockScout:

This view contains information that this token was bridged and a link to the original token.

BlockScout also distinguishes bridged tokens at the _Top of the tokens_ page by specifying the bridged property. A worker which fetches this property checks new unprocessed tokens every 1 minute and updates bridged status and it is bridged, adds a link to the original token.

## Approach \#2: Mediator storage

The multi-token mediator on the xDai chain \([`0xf6A78083ca3e2a662D6dd1703c939c8aCE2e268d`](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/address/0xf6A78083ca3e2a662D6dd1703c939c8aCE2e268d)\) provides methods for viewing correspondence of bridgeable tokens:

* `foreignTokenAddress` - returns the address of the token contract on the Ethereum Mainnet by specifying the address the token contract on the xDai chain.
* `homeTokenAddress` - returns the address of the token contract on the xDai chain by specifying the address of the token contract on the Ethereum chain.
